Reinforcement Learning in Machine Learning

This repository contains notes, implementations, and practice exercises related to Reinforcement Learning (RL), a branch of Machine Learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

📌 Topics Covered
1. Multi-Armed Bandits

Introduction to exploration vs. exploitation trade-off.

Implementing ε-greedy strategy.

Applications in online recommendation systems and A/B testing.

2. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)

Balancing exploration and exploitation with confidence intervals.

Mathematical intuition of UCB.

Practical implementation for bandit problems.

3. Thompson Sampling

Bayesian approach to reinforcement learning.

Sampling from probability distributions for decision making.

Comparison with ε-greedy and UCB.

4. Q-Learning

Understanding Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

The Bellman Equation.

Implementing Q-Learning with discrete environments.

Hands-on example using OpenAI Gym.
